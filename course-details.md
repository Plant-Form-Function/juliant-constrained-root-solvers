Researchers often need to solve for customized functions in their research.
However, writing and testing the function and solvers repeatly can be tedious
and boring. To ease the process, I tease the algorithm that I typically used
apart from research code, and make it a publically available Julia package. In
this course, I will show you how to use the root solvers of mine:

- `find_zero` to solve for the variable when the target function is 0
- `find_peak` to solve for the variable when the target function is maximized
